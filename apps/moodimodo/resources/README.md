### Automatic Location and Weather Logging (Optional)
By automatically recording your location in the background using GPS, we might be able to figure out how the 
amount of time spent at the gym, restaurants, doctors, offices, home, and work locations may be affecting you.   
Logging location enables weather logging to determine how things like temperature and sunlight exposure might 
be affecting you.  Another benefit of enabling this option is that allows the app to run in the background and 
open instantly instead of taking a few seconds to load.  You can view your location history by going to 
Menu -> History -> Locations.

Brain chemistry is influenced by a number of factors including social interaction, sleep, diet, medication,
and physical activity. Since the human mind is not powerful enough to retain all of the necessary information, 
this data integration feature is essential to identifying correlations and causal relationships.

Users will also have the option to anonymously donate their data to the Mind First Foundation, the Personal Genome 
Project, and other researchers in order to help facilitate the crowdsourced observational research which will 
eventually lead to the eradication of mental illness.
