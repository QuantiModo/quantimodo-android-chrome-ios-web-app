Start by creating a PubNub account. Your account must be configured specifically for ChatEngine using the tool below.

Your account should now be configured. You can log into your 
[PubNub Admin Portal](https://admin.pubnub.com/) to view your ChatEngine settings 
and continue with development.

In the portal, you will see that a ChatEngine application has been created
with publish and subscribe keys. The application has the Presence, Storage
& Playback, Functions and Access Manager features enabled, which are required
for ChatEngine. 

A PubNub Function has also been created which assists with securely accessing 
PubNub from a browser environment.
