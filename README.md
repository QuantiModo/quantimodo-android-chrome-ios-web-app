  # **Ionic Docker Image**
Ionic docker image for development, build and continous integration (and certainly useful for all Cordova projects in general as well)


## Why
- Installing Java and Android SDK is a pain
- Keeping your Node modules in sync and up-to-date is a pain
- Ensuring all project developers have exactly the same Java version, Android SDK, and node modules is a Sisyphos like task, not to mention your CI environment. 
- Using a standardized Docker image and a versionednDocker-Compose file for your project ensures an identical environment for all developers, testers, build bots etc.


## Features
- Based on Ubuntu 16.04
- Minimal assumptions/restrictions regarding your development environment and project structure
- Android SDK, Node, Npm, Yarn, Cordova, Ionic installed
- Easily set package versions (Java, Android, Node, Cordova, Ionic) via cli arguments based on your project requirements
- Map your local Cordova/Ionic project via docker volume
- package.json is continously watched and re-installed on changes
- Yarn available optionally
- Gulp available optionally


## Default versions
The following default versions are installed (for customizing see below):
- Java: 8
- Android platforms: 25
- Android build tools: 25.0.3
- Node: 6.9.5
- Npm: 5.3.0
- Cordova: 6.5.0
- Ionic: 3.6.1
- Typescript: 2.3.4
- Yarn: latest


## Quick start
Create your project directory
```
mkdir demoapp
cd demoapp
```

Download the docker-compose file
```
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mswag/docker-ionic/master/docker-compose.yml
```

Build the docker image (grab a coffee, this might take a while when you run it the first time)
```
docker-compose build
```
*This will only work, if you have docker already installed on your machine. If not, please look at the Usage section for more instructions.*

Start the development server
```
docker-compose up
```
Congratulations! Look at the default Ionic project at localhost:8100 that is served out of your Docker container.

**If you want to know, how to get your own Ionic project served and built out of the Docker container, follow the instructions below.**


## Usage
1. Install Docker 
Install docker for your platform [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/), [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) or [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/).


2. Build your image and start your container
You can build your image and start your container directly with docker. Or you can use docker-compose. In general, we recommend to download our compose file and work with docker-compose.

3. How to develop your local Ionic project in the Docker container
The provided image / container does have an Ionic app setup and installled in the directory /app. This app is only for demo purposes and not intended for development. You you should create / integrate your Ionic project from the host aka your development machine. Therefore, you map your local Ionic project directory to the container via a volume mapping. This will work out of the box if you follow instructions below.

By default, the Docker container has a start script that watches your package.json, which installs on start or on changes.


## Usage with docker-compose

To manage the build and run options in your project via cli parameters is a hassle and does not scale very well in larger project teams. Therefore, we recommend to use a compose file, which can be versioned and should be checked into your project repository.

1. Create your inital docker-compose.yml file

    Download it from our repository into your project root
    ```
    curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mswag/docker-ionic/develop/docker-compose.yml
    ```
    and customize it to your needs. However, the defaults should be good to start with.

2. Build your image

    After customizing your docker-compose file, build your project specific image
    ```
    docker-compose build
    ```

3. Run the container

    The default container command is "ionic serve -b". Thus,  by just starting the container via
    ```
    docker-compose up
    ```
    you will have your development server up and running on port 8100.

    You can change the default command by appending to cli call. E.g. this command
    ```
    docker-compose run ionic npm run test
    ```
    will start the unit tests.

4. Run specific one-off commands
    Use the run commaned for one-off commands. E.g. to build the Android APKs just run
    ```
    docker-compose run ionic ionic build android
    ```

    If you want to check the build configuration of your underlying container, just run
    ```
    docker-compose run ionic cat /image.config
    ```


## Usage with docker

1. Build your custom docker image

    ```
    docker build -tag [IMAGE_NAME] \
                 --build-arg [ARG=VALUE] \
                 https://github.com/mswag/docker-ionic
    ```
    (this might take a while the first time)

    Please choose an appropriate IMAGE_NAME for the built image; the name of your project might be a good idea.

    The following build arguments can be used to customize your image:
    - USER (mandatory, default: ionic): the project user, which will be used to run this Docker container
    - JAVA_VERSION (mandatory, default: 8): the java version that should be installed and used to run the Android SDKstalled and used by Cordova
    - ANDROID_PLATFORMS_VERSION (mandatory, default: 25): the Android SDK Tools platforms version that should be installed and used by Cordova
    - ANDROID_BUILD_TOOLS_VERSION (mandatory, default: 25.0.3): the Android build tools version that should be installed and used by Cordova
    - NODE_VERSION (mandatory, default: 6.9.1): the node version that should be installed globally and used by Cordova and Ionic
    - NPM_VERSION (mandatory, default: 5.3.0): the npm version that will be installed with node globally
    - PACKAGE_MANAGER (mandatory, default: npm): if yarn or npm should be used as package manager
    - CORDOVA_VERSION (mandatory, default: 6.5.0): the Cordova version that will be installed globally and used by Ionic to build the Android APKs
    - IONIC_VERSION (optional, default: 2.2.1): the Ionic version that will be installed globally to power your project
    - TYPESCRIPT_VERSION (optional, default: 2.0.3): the Typescript version that will be installed globally to translate your .ts files
    - GULP_VERSION (optional, default: none): the Gulp version that will be installed globally to run your gulp tasks

    *Example for Ionic 2 project*:
    ```
    docker build --tag my-great-ionic2-project \
                 --build-arg USER="$USER"
                 https://github.com/mswag/docker-ionic
    ```
    This will generate a Docker image named "my-great-ionic2-project" with the default configuration and a user, who's name is identical to the one on the host.


2. Feel free to use your image and connect with a bash shell: 

    ```
    docker run --name "my-great-ionic2-project" -it \
               -v $PWD:/app:rw \
               -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
               -u `id -u $USER` \
               -p 3000:3000 -p 5000:5000 -p 8100:8100 -p 8080:8080 -p 9876:9876 -p 35729:35729 \                                                     
               my-great-ionic2-project-container
    ```
    This will run the created image with the following features:

   - **Project Directory**:
    
        The option ```-v $PWD:/app:rw``` will map your hosts current directory to /app in the container. This should  allways be our project root directory, where the package.jsons ist provided.

    - **USB Devices**:
    
        The option ```-v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb``` will map your hosts usb ports such that you can build/deploy your project directly to your device.
        
        **Attention**: this will not work on osx.

    - **Container User Id**
        
        The option ```-u `id -u $USER``` will run the container with the current user's id. This will avoid permissions issues on the host.

    - **Port Mappings**
        
        The defined port mappings ("-p") do map the following ports from the container to the host:
        - 3000: Angular Lite Server
        - 5000: node
        - 8100: ionic
        - 8080: webpack
        - 9876: karma
        - 35729: ionic livereload

Now you have a Docker container, that you can use to develop, build and serve your Ionic (or Cordova) project.

## FAQs
* Why are you using Ubuntu 16.04 as base Docker image instead of smaller ones like Alpine?*

    The goal of this image is to have a standardized development and build environment. Therefore the image should meet a developer's needs in terms of tools, command line usage etc. Since it is not planned to use this image in production or for deployment, minimizing size was not in scope.

* Why is this image not available on the Docker hub?

    The idea of this image is to have a custom build for your requirements. You might even want to have a separate image per project.

* Why are you not running as the root user (like most other ionic images)?

    Because this might cause permission issues on your host's mapped application directory. Furthermore, cli calls, tools behavior etc. would differ from a developer's host workflow.

* How do I deploy my APK to a device on a mac

    TODO: 

## Roadmap & ToDos
* Enable yarn version pinning
* Review installed Android versions
* Enable cache volume mapping from the client
