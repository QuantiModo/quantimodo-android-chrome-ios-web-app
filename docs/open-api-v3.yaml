Access token can then be used to query API endpoints. ### Request Access Token After user approves your access to the given scope form the https:/app.quantimo.do/v1/oauth2/authorize endpoint, you''ll receive an authorization code to request an access token. This time make a `POST` request to `/api/v1/oauth/access_token` with parameters including: * `grant_type` Can be `authorization_code` or `refresh_token` since we are getting the `access_token` for the first time we don''t have a `refresh_token` so this must be `authorization_code`. * `code` Authorization code you received with the previous request. * `redirect_uri` Your application''s redirect url. ### Refreshing Access Token Access tokens expire at some point, to continue using our api you need to refresh them with `refresh_token` you received along with the `access_token`. To do this make a `POST` request to `/api/v1/oauth/access_token` with correct parameters, which are: * `grant_type` This time grant type must be `refresh_token` since we have it. * `clientId` Your application''s client id. * `client_secret` Your application''s client secret. * `refresh_token` The refresh token you received with the `access_token`. Every request you make to this endpoint will give you a new refresh token and make the old one expired. So you can keep getting new access tokens with new refresh tokens. ### Using Access Token Currently we support 2 ways for this, you can''t use both at the same time. * Adding access token to the request header as `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}` * Adding to the url as a query parameter `?access_token={access_token}` You can read more about OAuth2 from [here](http://oauth.net/2/)'

            Ex: As with any human experiment, it was impossible to control for all potentially confounding variables.
                        Correlation does not necessarily imply correlation.  We can never know for sure if one factor is definitely the cause of an outcome.
                        However, lack of correlation definitely implies the lack of a causal relationship.  Hence, we can with great
                        confidence rule out non-existent relationships. For instance, if we discover no relationship between mood
                        and an antidepressant this information is just as or even more valuable than the discovery that there is a relationship.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We can also take advantage of several characteristics of time series data from many subjects  to infer the likelihood of a causal relationship if we do find a correlational relationship.
                        The criteria for causation are a group of minimal conditions necessary to provide adequate evidence of a causal relationship between an incidence and a possible consequence.
                        The list of the criteria is as follows:
                        <br>
                        1. Strength (effect size): A small association does not mean that there is not a causal effect, though the larger the association, the more likely that it is causal.
                        <br>
                        2. Consistency (reproducibility): Consistent findings observed by different persons in different places with different samples strengthens the likelihood of an effect.
                        <br>
                        3. Specificity: Causation is likely if a very specific population at a specific site and disease with no other likely explanation. The more specific an association between a factor and an effect is, the bigger the probability of a causal relationship.
                        <br>
                        4. Temporality: The effect has to occur after the cause (and if there is an expected delay between the cause and expected effect, then the effect must occur after that delay).
                        <br>
                        5. Biological gradient: Greater exposure should generally lead to greater incidence of the effect. However, in some cases, the mere presence of the factor can trigger the effect. In other cases, an inverse proportion is observed: greater exposure leads to lower incidence.
                        <br>
                        6. Plausibility: A plausible mechanism between cause and effect is helpful.
                        <br>
                        7. Coherence: Coherence between epidemiological and laboratory findings increases the likelihood of an effect.
                        <br>
                        8. Experiment: "Occasionally it is possible to appeal to experimental evidence".
                        <br>
                        9. Analogy: The effect of similar factors may be considered.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                         The confidence in a causal relationship is bolstered by the fact that time-precedence was taken into account in all calculations. Furthermore, in accordance with the law of large numbers (LLN), the predictive power and accuracy of these results will continually grow over time.  146 paired data points were used in this analysis.   Assuming that the relationship is merely coincidental, as the participant independently modifies their Very Distracting Time values, the observed strength of the relationship will decline until it is below the threshold of significance.  To it another way, in the case that we do find a spurious correlation, suggesting that banana intake improves mood for instance,
                        one will likely increase their banana intake.  Due to the fact that this correlation is spurious, it is unlikely
                        that you will see a continued and persistent corresponding increase in mood.  So over time, the spurious correlation will
                        naturally dissipate.Furthermore, it will be very enlightening to aggregate this data with the data from other participants  with similar genetic, diseasomic, environmentomic, and demographic profiles.
        studyObjective:
          type: string
          description: 'Ex: The objective of this study is to determine the nature of the relationship (if any) between the Very Distracting Time and the Video Activities. Additionally, we attempt to determine the Very Distracting Time values most likely to produce optimal Video Activities values.'
        studyResults:
          type: string
          description: 'Ex: This analysis suggests that higher Very Distracting Time generally predicts negative Video Activities (p = 0.097). Video Activities is, on average, 36%  higher after around 2.03 Very Distracting Time.  After an onset delay of 168 hours, Video Activities is, on average, 16%  lower than its average over the 168 hours following around 1.04 Very Distracting Time.  146 data points were used in this analysis.  The value for Very Distracting Time changed 2984 times, effectively running 1492 separate natural experiments. The top quartile outcome values are preceded by an average 2.03 h of Very Distracting Time.  The bottom quartile outcome values are preceded by an average 1.04 h of Very Distracting Time.  Forward Pearson Correlation Coefficient was 0.354 (p=0.097, 95% CI -0.437 to 1.144 onset delay = 0 hours, duration of action = 168 hours) .  The Reverse Pearson Correlation Coefficient was 0.208 (P=0.097, 95% CI -0.583 to 0.998, onset delay = -0 hours, duration of action = -168 hours).

                Splash screen dimensions vary for each platform, device, and orientation, so a square source image is required to generate each of the various screen sizes.
                            The source image’s minimum dimensions should be 2208×2208 px, and the artwork should be centered within the square, because each generated image will be center cropped into landscape and portrait images.
                            The splash screen’s artwork should roughly fit within a center square (1200×1200 px). <a href="http://code.ionicframework.com/resources/splash.psd">This template</a> provides the recommended size and guidelines about artwork’s safe zone.
              textLogo: 'Ideally, a 100px high by 500px wide png with a transparent background containing the name of your app that looks good on a dark background.'

                              The source image’s minimum dimensions should be 2208×2208 px, and the artwork should be centered within the square, because each generated image will be center cropped into landscape and portrait images.
                              The splash screen’s artwork should roughly fit within a center square (1200×1200 px). <a href="http://code.ionicframework.com/resources/splash.psd">This template</a> provides the recommended size and guidelines about artwork’s safe zone.
                textLogo: 'Ideally, a 100px high by 500px wide png with a transparent background containing the name of your app that looks good on a dark background.'
